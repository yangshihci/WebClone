            <h5>My quick story</h5>
            <p>
                <strong>I have been building web stuff since I was 11 years-old.</strong> 
                Back in the day I tinkered endlessly with the site builder 
                tool from Geocities and came up with a few sites where I 
                could host the Flash animations I was making for my friends. 
                Later, the game changed and the cool stuff was made with Dreamweaver, 
                so I used it to make fan-club websites for my favourite musicians. 
                When social media came around <strong>I was making myspace websites look 
                stunning</strong> (14 year old me thought so) with my sick html / css skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Since then I haven't stopped learning and creating.</strong> 
                I have been involved in music, photography, sound engineering, 
                electronic engineering, programming, video production, feature 
                film post-production, VR games, and 3D sound.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the last few years, I have been increasingly working on software 
                development in my professional life. I've been lucky to have worked 
                alongside senior developers and designers, who have taught me what's 
                expected from a quality product.
